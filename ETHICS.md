# Ethical Use Policy for MatRocket

MatRocket is a tool for **simulation**, **testing**, and **educational** purposes. Its development is guided by a commitment to responsible engineering and an awareness of the potential for misuse in sensitive domains.

## :white_check_mark: Permitted Uses

- Ground-based trajectory simulation
- Hardware-in-the-loop and model-in-the-loop testing (on the ground)
- Academic research and thesis work
- Internal R&D by companies, under simulation-only conditions

## :x: Prohibited Uses

You may not use this software for:

- Integration into onboard systems, flight computers, or real-time control systems
- Military targeting, weapons deployment, or lethal autonomous systems
- Missile, drone, or projectile deployment
- Use in any project or region under arms embargo or international sanctions

## :scales: Legal Responsibility

While we strive to prevent harmful use, the maintainers cannot control third-party implementations. We rely on users and contributors to act in good faith, and reserve the right to revoke access if the project is misused.

## :pray: Our Ethical Commitment

We believe simulation and control system research can serve peaceful, scientific, and educational goals, as well as keeping civilians protected. Please help us keep this project aligned with those values.
